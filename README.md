### A unified toolkit for timing and spectral analysis of X-ray and gamma-ray transient data.

## Prerequisites

### HEASoft

_Heapy_ will invoke certain software and commands from HEASoft, such as `xselect` and `ximage`. Please ensure that [`HEASoft`](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/heasoft/#install) is correctly installed on your system, and that the [`Calibration Database`](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/caldb/install.html) (CALDB) for the mission (e.g., `Swift`)  you are processing is also properly installed.

### Fermi GBM Data Tools

_Heapy_ obtains the orbital location and pointing information of `Fermi` by invoking `gbm_data_tools`. Therefore, if you require this functionality, please ensure that [`gbm_data_tools`](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/gbm/gbm_data_tools/gdt-docs/index.html#) is correctly installed in advance.

If you are using macOS with an Apple silicon chip, you may encounter difficulties compiling older versions of `matplotlib` (e.g., <= 3.2.1) when installing `gbm_data_tools`. One possible workaround is to first install a newer version of `matplotlib` (for example, version 3.8.4) and then install `gbm_data_tools` without performing dependency checks, using the following command:
```bash
$ pip3 install matplotlib==3.8.4
$ pip3 install --no-deps <path_to_tar>/gbm_data_tools-1.1.1.tar
```

### Fermi GBM Response Generator

_Heapy_ generates the response matrix files for Fermi GBM by invoking [`gbm_drm_gen`](https://github.com/grburgess/gbm_drm_gen). It is recommended to install my forked Python packages, which have been fine-tuned to resolve compatibility issues with newer versions of `numpy` and `astropy`, and to use TTE data instead of CSPEC data. The specific installation procedure is as follows:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jyangch/responsum.git
$ pip3 install ./responsum

$ git clone https://github.com/jyangch/gbmgeometry.git
$ pip3 install ./gbmgeometry

$ git clone https://github.com/jyangch/gbm_drm_gen.git
$ pip3 install ./gbm_drm_gen
```


## Installation

_Heapy_ is available via `pip`:
```bash
$ pip3 install heapyx
```
**NOTE**: The package name of _heapy_ in pypi is registered as `heapyx` rather than `heapy`, as the latter has already been taken.
